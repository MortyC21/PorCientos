# PorCientos
Covid Charity
A charity token that plans to use different blockchain's methods such as nft,
swaps and exchanges in order to help damaged people by the covid-19 virus.
A percentage of the transactions carried out with the token will go directly to
our funds, in order to do actions of good faith in Latin America. We will start
with the countries most affected by the pandemic, we will establish contact
with non-profit organizations such as CARE - Peru who are dedicated to
bringing aid to the neediest sectors of the country.
